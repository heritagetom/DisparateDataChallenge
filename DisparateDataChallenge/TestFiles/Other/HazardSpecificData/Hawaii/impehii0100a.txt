    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer contains impervious surface data for Hawaii, in an Albers Equal-Area Conic 
        projection and at a resolution of 100 meters.  The impervious surface data were derived from the 
        National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 percent developed imperviousness data set, a product of 
        the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC).  The MRLC is a multi-agency 
        cooperative effort to study land cover change.  The NLCD 2001 is described at 
        <http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2001.php>.  

      Purpose:
        The 100-meter resolution impervious surface data were developed to portray the impervious surface 
        of the United States at 1:1,000,000 scale.  They are intended primarily for visual purposes.  The 
        original NLCD data should be used for conducting scientific analysis.

      Supplemental_Information:
        NLCD data sets at 30-meter resolution may be downloaded from the MRLC Web site, 
        <http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd01_data.php>.  Further information on NLCD, related data sets, and land 
        cover research may be found at the online USGS Land Cover Institute <http://landcover.usgs.gov/>.

        Pixel values for impervious surface data and their corresponding RGB colors are listed in the color 
        ramp (.clr) file that accompanies the data set.

        This table shows all impervious surface classes and the RGB color values used to represent them.

        Pixel values 1 through 100 represent the percentage covered by impervious surface, such as 
        pavement, as seen from above.
        Pixel value 101 represents land in Canada or the British Virgin Islands.
        Pixel value 102 represents land in Mexico or Russia.
        Pixel value 103 represents land in The Bahamas and Cuba in the southeastern part of the data set.
        Pixel value 104 represents U.S. land that does not have valid data values.
        There are no null values in the image.

        Included with the GeoTIFF are an auxiliary information file (.aux.xml), an image overview file 
        (.ovr), a value attribute database file (.vat.dbf), a .tfw file (more information included below), 
        a .prj file (more information included below), and an Adobe Color Table (.act) file.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:	
          Four impervious surface mosaics at 30-meter resolution were downloaded from the MRLC Web site and 
          used to produce impervious surface data files of the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, 
          and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  NLCD stores data for the conterminous United 
          States, Alaska, and Hawaii in the same Albers Equal-area conic projection used by the National 
          Atlas.  Data for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (PRVI) were reprojected to match the 
          Albers projection parameters used by the National Atlas for that area.  All data were resampled 
          to 100-meter resolution and extents set to match National Atlas neatlines for the four areas.  
          This map layer includes the data file for Hawaii.

          Using the ArcGIS Feature-to-Raster command, a 0/1 land/water mask for Hawaii was created from 
          the 1:1,000,000-scale National Atlas coastline, at the same 100-meter resolution and with the 
          same extent as the impervious surface data.  The land/water mask was applied to the impervious 
          surface grid with a software routine that used the ArcGIS Multiply command to clip impervious 
          surface values that fell in ocean areas.  Impervious surface values were not filled out to the 
          coastline.

          Ocean areas were set to a pixel value of 0.  The land/water mask is available on request.

          In the conterminous United States impervious surface data set, non-data pixels were set to 
          separate values: 101 for Canada, 102 for Mexico, and 103 for The Bahamas and Cuba.  In 
          Alaska: 101 for Canada and 102 for Russia.  In PRVI: 101 for the British Virgin Islands.
