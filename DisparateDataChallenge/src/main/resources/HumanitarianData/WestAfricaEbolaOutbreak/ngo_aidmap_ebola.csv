Greatest Goal Ministries operates a free outpatient hospital in Lakka.  The military has set up Ebola isolation tents directly outside the doors of our hospital.  This project will provide the desperately needed supplies and protective clothing for health care workers as well as support information materials needed for the community.<br><br> The Ebola virus disease has been detected for the first time in West Africa.  Fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of the Ebola virus and then transmitted to people.  The virus is passed from person to person through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.  There is no vaccine and no specific treatment available.  It is 90% fatal. 458 confirmed cases have now been documented from all districts of Sierra Leone with 153 deaths reported.<br><br> The citizens of Sierra Leone need to understand that Ebola is a medical disease. They need to start understanding how this disease is spread and how to prevent further spread.  This can only be done in the community through media, leaflets and door to door sensitization programs.  This project will help provide funding for these community awareness programs.  Healthcare workers need to be protected from contracting the disease. This project will provide funds for personal protective equipment.<br><br> Sierra Leone has some of the poorest health indicators in the world and the least amount of resources to adequately protect healthcare workers.  For the capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown, this is an important time. Raising awareness of the risk factors for infection and protective measures that should be taken is the only way to stop this epidemic. If the outbreak is not contained, health officials are worried that it may spread to other countries in the region.","","",2014-07-30,2015-11-13,"","Health,Humanitarian aid,Non-food relief items (NFIs)","",31879.0,"Greatest Goal Ministries USA","","",,"","Sierra Leone>Western",http://globalgiving.org/17787,2014-12-17,2015-01-13,active,"Private donations"

In 2014, Guinea and neighboring countries experienced the ebola infection. As at March 2015, the country of Guinea had recorded 3,011 confirmed cases of Ebola virus infection. Out of this number 2,263 died. The consequence of this is that life in the country was virtually brought to a standstill. To begin with, many families are devastated with deaths of family members, breadwinners and care givers. This has weakened the already fragile economic situation in many families, worsening the situation of poverty in communities, the church and the country. At the peak of the Ebola infections, many companies either closed down or scaled down activities drastically and sending employees home destroying the source of livelihood for even the survivors of ebola. The emotional trauma caused by the deaths have left the church with a huge task of restoring hope in life for the survivors. Also children are who have lost parents are now left as orphans, some needing daily provision to survive, shelter and clothing. Ebola has interrupted the education for some of these children without hope of having a meaningful future. These problems caused by Ebola comes as an add on to the challenge of Malaria which the church has been working with Episcopal Relief & Development to mitigate. At the height of the crisis it was difficult for primary health workers to differentiate malaria from ebola thereby wrongly categorizing cases of malaria as ebola and by that exposing the persons concerned to ebola infection even at the health centers. Also activities that were outlined for malaria control by the government and other agencies like the church which involved household visits and community level gatherings were suspended; and thus affecting the gains that would otherwise have been made in the control of malaria. In the light of these developments, the Anglican church of Guinea is aiming at reducing the combined sufferings of Ebola, Malaria and Diarrhea and to consolidate the gains made in malaria control in the past through the 2015 year. The church also hopes to ensure that all persons suspected of having ebola receive prompt and adequate treatment in the health facilities as well as malaria promptly treated in the community. With support from Episcopal Relief and Development, the Anglican Diocese of Guinea intends to embark on massive information, education and communication on management of malaria and diarrhea at the community level. The church intends to return to the use of door to door conversation and community level gatherings for drama performance to achieve this. Furthermore both community level and facility level health workers would be trained to ensure that the appropriate care is being provided. It is anticipated that by the close of 2015, the usage of LLINs would have improved in the project areas leading to reduced numbers of malaria cases.","Community Volunteers training,Sensitization of households,Household visits,Monitoring,Training of facility based Professional health workers,Establishing referral system with professional health workers","",2015-04-14,2015-12-30,"",Health,"",,"","Diocese of Guinea","",,"Family members,Children < 5",Guinea,http://www.episcopalrelief.org,2015-07-06,2015-07-06,active,""

Using mHero, ministries can instantly send critical information to health workers’ mobile phones, including reports of emerging cases, reminders about safety protocols, and reference and training materials.","mHero, currently under rapid development, is a free SMS mobile phone-based system designed for communication among Ministry of Health staff, health workers, and community health workers. By supporting the interoperability of human resources information systems, such as IntraHealth’s iHRIS, with UNICEF’s SMS, and utilizing the OpenHIE architecture, the platform can immediately use health workforce data to target specific communications based on cadre, location, and other information. Communications, which can be triggered both centrally and locally, go far beyond traditional “message blasts” offered by many technology vendors. Real-time monitoring, complex multipath surveys, monitoring, and detailed analysis can readily be conducted. Further, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) mLearning approaches will take knowledge delivery one step beyond SMS with higher content limits, while also addressing literacy and language divides through spoken language.
